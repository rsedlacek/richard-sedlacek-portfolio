  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
I currently work for <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com" style="color: orange"><b>BNY Mellon</b></a> as a business analyst supporting the Wealth Management line of business. I have been interested in <b> <font color = "black"> technology </font></b> since I received my first (Gateway) computer as a Christmas gift circa 2000. I have also always been interested in <b> <font color = "black"> business</font></b>, particulary <b> <font color = "black"> finance</font></b>, which is pretty much how I ended up working in IT, supporing a financial line of business; it really is the best of both worlds for me. I have been there for about 7 years and have really enjoyed the changing environment of both IT and business and really do learn something new everyday.<br><br>

I have a beautiful daughter named Reaghan, a wonderful wife, Katie, and a second child on the way (July 20, 2015).<br><br>

Continuing education is also a very important aspect of my life, which is why I am here, creating this webpage.<br><br>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>
I live in Pennsylvania, more specifically the greater Pittsburgh area. I have lived in a number of the surrounding areas of the city all of my life and as much as I complain about the winters, especially today, as I gaze out my window to snow covered hills and streets, I really do love Pittsburgh. My family moved into our house in April of 2014 where we plan to stay for quite some time.<br><br>
    
I am an MBA graduate of Point Park University, located in Pittsburgh and I received my BSBA from Geneva College in May of 2008, located in Beaver Falls, which is about 45 miles northwest of the city.<br><br>

<p>I have always found the gaming industry to be very intriguing. I always see people in suits walking around casino's with tablets - something along those lines would be fun. Knowing how the industry works at an executive-type level.</p><br>
